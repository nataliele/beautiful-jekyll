My background is in healthcare services research and I have written a couple of papers for my econometrics classes. I'm submitting my master paper to Health Affairs journal so crossing fingers on that!

One [paper](/_data/health_expenditure.pdf) that I wrote is about comparing health expenditure between immigrants and US-born residents. Read on if you're interested.

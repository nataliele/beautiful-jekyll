My background is in healthcare services research and I have written a couple of papers for my econometrics classes.

My [Master paper](https://github.com/nataliele/nataliele.github.io/blob/master/_data/ACA_Small_group_and_large_group.docx) is about the effect of the Accountable Care Act on small businesses versus large business. I found a reduction of 3 percentage points (p<0.001) in the uninsured rate for small-group versus large-group employees. However, small-group employees have come to rely more on public insurance and private insurance rather than employer-sponsored insurance relative to large-group employees. As a result, when significant changes happen to Medicaid or the individual market, small-group employees might be greatly affected.

Another [paper](https://github.com/nataliele/nataliele.github.io/blob/master/_data/health_expenditure.pdf) that I wrote is about comparing health expenditure between immigrants and US-born residents. Despite popular belief that immigrants (people who were born outside the US) are a burden on the system, this paper showed that they actually spent much less on health care than US-born people. Read on if you're interested.

This is a very simple drawing app I made for my Python programming class back in 2016. My biggest takeaway from that class is not the Python syntax, funny enough, but how to think and approach a problem before, during and after the coding process. Elliott, my awesome professor and founder of ![Trinket](https://trinket.io/), made us write down our thought processes, milestones, lessons learned etc. I complained about it back then but now I think those are the things that really made me a better programmer.

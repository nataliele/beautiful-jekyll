This is a quick and simple recommender system for skincare products based on [Amazon reviews](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html). I used the 5-score dataset, which means all users and items in this dataset have at least 5 reviews.

Go to the [notebook](https://github.com/nataliele/nataliele.github.io/blob/master/_data/amazon.ipynb).

## Goals
Develop a recommender system to help consumers choose skincare products based on reviews from people with similar skin characteristics and experience.

The US beauty industry is a [18-billion dollar business](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2018/us-prestige-beauty-industry-sales-rise-6-percent-in-2017-reports-the-npd-group/). People, especially women, are on the constant look-out for their "Holy Grail" products. And as with many things in life, you dont know if it works until you try it. People react to products differently: skin types, races, age, ingredients, personal preference are all contributing factors. With a recommender system, we can limit this trial-and-error process. Skip the products that are likely break us out and go straight to the more potential ones. 


## Approach and Data source
The two main sources of skincare product reviews that I know of are Amazon and [MakeupAlley](https://www.makeupalley.com/product/). I chose to go with MakeupAlley because it is a popular beauty review website and has data on attributes that I want to look at such as skin color, age etc. MakeupAlley is also less prone to fake reviews than Amazon.

The milestones that I envision for the project are:

- [x] scrape MakeupAlley website for reviews on skincare products
- [ ] parse data into desired types and generate features
- [ ] build recommender system
- [ ] deploy on website


## Deliverables
- Recommender system for skincare products with a web app interface

Additional features that will be nice to have:
- I have a review database from Amazon but to link it with products in MUA I need to get products' UPC numbers from Amazon. So I would have to scrape Amazon for those numbers.
- Add other kinds of beauty products outside of skincare.

## Progress
I've finished the first step: crawling through 2,748,608 reviews of 171,350 products. Having decided to focus on just skincare, my subset of data consists of 371,986 reviews for 6,056 products.
